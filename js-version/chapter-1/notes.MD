# Eloquent Javascript

## Ch. 1

Javascript has 6 distinct value types.

### Numbers
Numbers are simply represented as numbers, like 13, 9.81 or 2.998e8. Basic arithmetic can be applied to numbers, including the remainder operator %.


Infinity and -Infinity are also numbers, as is NaN.

### Strings
Strings represent text, surrouded by quotes like "this bit of text".


(\\) escapes the next character. Using this, you can add newlines (\n), tabs (\t) and quotes (\") to a string.

(+) can be used to concatenate strings. "this is a con" + "catenated string" produces "this is a concatenated string".

### Unary operator
`typeof` is a unary operator in that it only takes one value and produces a result. For instance, console.log(typeof "x") --> "string".

### Boolean values
